# Build Your Own AI Email Classifier

**From Idea to Production: A Complete Guide to Building AI-Powered Tools**

This project shows you how to take an idea ("I want to classify emails automatically") and turn it into a working AI system with a web interface, API backend, and trained machine learning model.

## What You'll Learn

- **How to structure an AI project from scratch**
- **Decide what to build and how long to spend building it**
- **How to train and deploy a BERT model**
- **How to build a web interface within a notebook**

## Project Architecture


## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd emailClassify
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```





##  What You'll Build

### **AI Email Classifier Features:**
- **6 Categories**: CarTheft, CarCrash, CarWindshield, CarBreakdown, CarRenewal, Other
- **BERT Model**: State-of-the-art transformer for text classification
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit app for email classification
- **API Backend**: FastAPI service for model serving
- **Training Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data generation to model deployment

## Learning Path


## Key Technologies

- **Python +**
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: BERT model implementation
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework


- **Pandas**: Data manipulation


## Customization Guide

This project is designed to be easily adaptable to your own use case:

- **Change Categories**: Modify `categories.json` and retrain
- **Different Model**: Swap BERT for other transformers
- **New Data Sources**: Integrate with your own data pipelines
- **Additional Features**: Add authentication, logging, monitoring
